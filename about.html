		<p>I lived in California for most of my life. I have a BA from UC Riverside and I love history and foreign policy. In my spare time I like to go bowling, karting, and hiking. I have got introduced to programming and Ruby specificaly a few months before I joined DBC. A quirky thing about me is that the only sport that I actually follow is Formula 1.
