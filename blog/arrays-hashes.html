<h2>Arrays and Hashes</h2>
<h3> Explanations of Collections</h3>
</header>

<p>
	Arrays are collections of objects that are ordered pairs. That means they have a consisten and consecute numerical order in which the values are located inside the array and thus can be referenced that way. It is imporant to note that in arrays the first character is [0], not 1. This was accepted as a standart in pogramming because it avoids errors down the line when arrays get large, and programs - complicated. Any ruby object can be placed inside an array. 
</p>
	<p>
	Hashes are collections that have key-value pairs. This means that each value has a key associated with it. They key is kept constant even the ordering inside the hash changes. This provides a more reliable way to call on values inside a hash. Hashes can be created using Hash.new method, which can then defive how many key-value pairs it will have. Another way is to put in the values such as hash-name [:one => 1, :two=>2]. Notice the semi-colin before each key, that means those keys are symbols. Symbols are useful in hashes because they are able to keep a constant value through the program (while not being have to declare global variables, because thats bad practice). A CS major once told me that a symbol in ruby will also use less memory that a string. 
	</p>
<p>
	Arrays and hashes are very popular in ruby because they allow for handling collections of data. Ruby also has many useful methods to be used for dealing with arrays and hashes. 
</p>
<p>
	For arrays some method examples are: .&lt;&lt;= to add a value to an array; .delete = to delete a value; .concat = to merge arrays together;  </p>
	<p>
	For hashes: .new=to create a new class while invicoking Hash class; .empty? = to check if hash is empty; .each = to iterate over the hash, .length = to calculate length of hash, .merge = to merge hashes together etc.
