<h2> Margin, Border, and Padding in CSS</h2>

  <p>
    In order to understand what Margin, Border, and Padding do it is important to visualize a box model(see picture). The first thing inside the box is the conent that is actually displayed on the page. It could be a block of text or an image. After that there is an area before the border called padding. After padding comes the actualy border of the content. And the very last element in this model is the margin, which dictates how much space is between border and whatever is outside of it (be it another element or the end of a webpage). It may help to think of this model as an onion, which peels away to reveal another layer until the content is reached inside.

    We can set certain values and parameters to each of the above mentioned elements of CSS. Each of them may be given size values to determing how big or small they will be. The size of padding and margin will not actually be seen, but they determing the placement of the content on a page. Border may be given a color and a style (such as dotted, dashed, double, solid). 
    Below is a diagram of the box model:
