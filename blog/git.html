     When a single person is working on a piece of writing or a program, they can quickly save their work or undo any changes made that turned out to be detrimental. However, when a group of developers whether it be code or content, collaborate together to build a single project, version control becomes a very important issue. Without any version control or with a poorly set up version control, a competent team of engineers may run circles around each other and not come up with a solution to a problem, which they would otherwise solve quickly.

        What exactly is version control? It is a system that allows for backup logs, tracking of changes, and tracking of submissions from individual contributors to a larger project. When two people are separately working on the same piece of code, they are in danger of saving over each others work, nullifying their progress. What version control programs, such as Git, do is allow each person to create a copy of the project to work on, the save the changes to that copy. After that the code may be reviewed by team leaders to make sure it doesn't break anything, and only then it would be implemented. This process allows for individual contributions to be complied together to complete a larger goal. It allows for the project to be broken down to smaller pieces, where individuals or small groups work on each piece, then assemble all those pieces in an organized fashion.

        Github is a popular remote repository that is used today. It is a cloud storage used specifically with Git version control. It may help to think of it as Dropbox, Google Drive, or Microsoft OneDrive, which was made to specifically work with Git software set up on a local machine. This means that most of the interaction with Github may occur on command line, which allows for a developer(who already “lives” in the terminal) to save time on menial tasks such as saving progress or pulling other peoples work.
