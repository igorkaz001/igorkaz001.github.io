		<p>In this blog post I will describe and explain the way classes work in Ruby. For this I will use an example of going into a fast food joint to get dinner. </p>
		<p> First, it is important to understand the concept of class in Ruby. It is a blueprint for a process to be repeated in the exact way that is described in the class (with different values and outcomes), but more on that at the end. In this case dinner will be the main class. When a customer comes into the restaurant, they place an order and give their name to be associated with that order. These could be likened to the initialize method in the class to establish instance variables to be filled by the user (or customer). When the costumer gave the order it is repeated back to them. This is like an attr_reader that allows the user to view the information about the object such the order and make sure they entered it accurately. Once the order is verified an operation is performed where the total is calculated and payment is accepted. This operation is like the first method to be called after the initialization method in the class. If the result of this operation is good: payment is made, then the cooks started to make the order the back. This is like other methods in the class being invoked in certain order once the previous once complete. The way the burger is made could be a separate method, the way fries are made - a method, put it all on the correct plate to match up with the customer name - another method. </p>
		<p>When I mentioned earlier that the ruby class is a blueprint, it is made to be instanced. This means the restaurant is set up to perform the same exact functions and offer exact same items for each customer. They will ask each person to make a selection on their menu, so a customer cant just order a shirt, or a car. It has to be food, specific to the restaurant. Then they will take the name to track the order and proccess payment. Also, the way a hamburger is made is the same process all day long.</p>
		<p>Thus a class is not the dinner that the customer will eat, but a way that dinner is ordered, prepared, and released in a prompt and accurate manner to every customer. </p>
